# Cloud File Storage

• Developed a Cloud file storage application with frontend App in flutter and custom back-end implemented using
Django Rest Framework

• Implemented authentication using Firebase and then used the JWT authentication tokens from Firebase to
Authorise the user accessing the APIs endpoint

• Implement monthly premium subscription using Stripe

• Users can share there file link and can later make that link private if they don’t want anyone with the link to access
the file

• We can also download the file on our local device
